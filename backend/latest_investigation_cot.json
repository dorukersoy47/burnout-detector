      "agent_thoughts": "### STEP 1: Generate Hypotheses\n\n**AGENT THINKS:**\n\nThe alert provides several clues about potential root causes for the productivity drop. These clues are:\n\n1. **High PR Review Time**: The significant increase in PR review time might indicate a bottleneck in the code review process.\n2. **Blocked PRs**: With 12 PRs blocked, there could be specific technical issues causing delays.\n3. **Meeting Load**: With 7 meeting hours per day, Alice and Bob might be spending too much time in meetings, reducing their available work time.\n4. **Team Sentiment or Other Blockers**: Issues in team morale or communication might be contributing to the problem.\n\n**HYPOTHESES:**\n\n1. **H1: Code Review Bottleneck** - The PR review process is taking longer than usual, causing delays.\n2. **H2: Technical Blockers** - Specific technical issues are blocking the PRs.\n3. **H3: Meeting Overload** - Alice and Bob have too many meetings, limiting their productive time.\n4. **H4: Team Sentiment Issues** - Low morale or communication issues are affecting productivity.\n\n### STEP 2: Plan Data Collection\n\n**ACTION PLAN:**\n\n1. **H1**: Check PR metrics to analyze review times and identify bottlenecks.\n2. **H2**: Check for critical GitHub issues that could be blocking work.\n3. **H3**: Review calendar events for Alice and Bob to verify their meeting load.\n4. **H4**: Examine Slack messages for mentions of blockers, burnout, or team sentiment.\n\n**EXECUTE DATA COLLECTION:**\n\nUsing parallel tool calls to efficiently gather data for each hypothesis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_uses\": [\n    {\n      \"recipient_name\": \"functions.github_get_pr_metrics\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"repo\": \"owner/repo\",\n        \"days\": 7\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"recipient_name\": \"functions.github_get_issues\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"repo\": \"owner/repo\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"recipient_name\": \"functions.calendar_get_events\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"person\": \"alice\",\n        \"days\": 7\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"recipient_name\": \"functions.calendar_get_events\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"person\": \"bob\",\n        \"days\": 7\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"recipient_name\": \"functions.slack_get_messages\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"channel\": \"team-channel\",\n        \"query\": \"blocker OR burnout OR meeting\",\n        \"days\": 7\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### STEP 3: Analyze Evidence\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\n- **PR Metrics**: High review times and blocked PRs suggest a bottleneck.\n- **GitHub Issues**: Check for unresolved critical issues blocking progress.\n- **Calendar Events**: Check Alice and Bob's meeting schedules for excess meetings.\n- **Slack Messages**: Look for team sentiment indicators.\n\n### STEP 4: Reflect on Hypotheses\n\n**REFLECTION:**\n\n1. **H1 (Code Review Bottleneck)**: High PR review times already point towards this hypothesis. Further evidence needed from PR metrics.\n2. **H2 (Technical Blockers)**: If critical issues are present, this hypothesis gains weight.\n3. **H3 (Meeting Overload)**: 7 hours of meetings per day is excessive; confirmation needed from calendar data.\n4. **H4 (Team Sentiment Issues)**: Slack messages will help to determine if this is a factor.\n\n### STEP 5: Decision Making\n\nAnalyze gathered evidence to determine the strongest hypothesis and identify the root cause.",
